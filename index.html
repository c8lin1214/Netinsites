				<h4>Consulting</h4>
				<p>At NetInsites we know that using the Internet effectively is more than using a Designer to put together a Website. Your Internet strategy must be integrated within your business planning process and should ensure that you communicate more successfully with all your stakeholders</p>

				<h4>E-Commerce</h4>
				<p>Your e-commerce site will be based on OpenCart an open source e-commerce system. We have modified and improved the OpenCart system. You will need to choose one of the available OpenCart templates to set the structure of the site. The idea is to make the selling of your products the focus of the site.</p>

				<h4>Web Development</h4>
				<p>Before we build a Website we look closely at the strategy behind the proposal and make sure it fits with the proposed design and structure. Although we use the latest Internet technology and keep up with the latest trends the effectiveness of the Website always comes first. If your business isn't improved by initiating or upgrading your Web presence then the project is a failure.</p>
